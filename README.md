# Spring-Demo-Setter-Based-DI

Mini demo to try spring setter-based DI.

Class `Employee` is the bean which we will use to create instances. There are also two utils Class: `JsonOutputHelper` and `XmlOutputHelper` to output employee infos on JSON/XML.

This demo will use setter-based DI to create two different instances of Class `Employee`:

1. Employee infos by xml configuration.
2. Util class, so which way to output employee infos
